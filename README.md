# Thinking in React

In this project, I use React basics to make my first web app to learn the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React. I learned that:
- Components are aligned in a hierarchy
- It's better to build the static version of an app before the interactivity
- Promps are ways of passing data from parent to child
- State is used to build interactivity

Enjoy!
